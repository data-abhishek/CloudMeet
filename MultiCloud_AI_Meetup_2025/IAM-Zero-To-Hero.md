##   Use Case: "Global Web Application Deployment"

**Scenario:**

A global company, "GlobalCorp," is deploying a new web application that will be accessed by employees and customers worldwide. The application is hosted across AWS and Azure to ensure high availability and low latency for users in different regions. GlobalCorp uses a combination of on-premises Active Directory and cloud-based identity providers.

**IAM Requirements:**

1.  **Employee Access:**
    * Employees should be able to access the application using their existing on-premises Active Directory credentials.
    * Access should be controlled based on their job role (e.g., administrators, developers, customer support).
    * MFA should be enforced for all employees accessing the application from outside the corporate network.

2.  **Customer Access:**
    * Customers should be able to register and log in to the application using a self-service portal.
    * Social login (e.g., Google, Facebook) should be supported for customer convenience.
    * Customer data should be stored securely and isolated from employee data.

3.  **Server Access:**
    * Servers hosting the application in both AWS and Azure should be joined to the on-premises Active Directory domain for centralized management.
    * Administrators should be able to access the servers using their AD credentials.
    * Group Policies should be used to enforce security settings on the servers.

4.  **Multi-Cloud IAM:**
    * A centralized IAM solution should be implemented to manage identities and access policies across AWS and Azure.
    * Users should be able to authenticate once and access resources in both clouds (single sign-on).
    * Access policies should be defined centrally and applied consistently across both cloud environments.

**Implementation Details:**

1.  **IAM Fundamentals:**
    * GlobalCorp will adhere to the principle of least privilege by granting users only the necessary permissions to access the application and its resources.
    * Authentication will be used to verify the identity of users, and authorization will be used to determine what resources they can access.
    * MFA will be implemented to add an extra layer of security for employee access.

2.  **AWS IAM:**
    * AWS IAM will be used to manage access to AWS resources.
    * IAM roles will be created for EC2 instances to access other AWS services.
    * IAM policies will be attached to roles to define the permissions.
    * AWS Organizations will be used to manage multiple AWS accounts.

3.  **Azure AD:**
    * Azure AD will be used to manage identities for employees and some partners.
    * Azure AD Connect will be used to synchronize identities from on-premises Active Directory to Azure AD.
    * Conditional Access policies will be configured to enforce MFA and other access controls.
    * Managed identities will be used for applications running on Azure to access other Azure services.

4.  **Amazon Cognito:**
    * Amazon Cognito will be used to manage customer identities.
    * User pools will be created to store customer user profiles.
    * Identity pools will be used to grant customers access to AWS resources.
    * Cognito will be integrated with social identity providers (Google, Facebook).

5.  **Integrating Identity Providers:**
    * SAML 2.0 will be used to federate employee identities from on-premises Active Directory to Azure AD.
    * OpenID Connect will be used to allow customers to log in with social identity providers.
    * OAuth 2.0 will be used to authorize access to APIs.

6.  **Server Access with AD:**
    * EC2 instances in AWS and virtual machines in Azure will be joined to the on-premises Active Directory domain.
    * Group Policies will be created to manage server configurations, such as password policies and security settings.
    * Kerberos authentication will be used for secure authentication to the servers.

7.  **Multi-Cloud IAM:**
    * GlobalCorp will implement a centralized IAM solution (e.g., Okta, Ping Identity) to manage identities and access policies across AWS and Azure.
    * The solution will provide single sign-on (SSO) for users to access resources in both clouds.
    * Policies will be defined in the centralized solution and pushed to AWS and Azure.
    * This approach will ensure consistent security and simplify IAM management across the multi-cloud environment.
