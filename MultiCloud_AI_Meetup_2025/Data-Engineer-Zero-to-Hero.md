###   Storage Fundamentals & Object Storage (Cloud Focus)

Topics: Introduction to different types of storage (block, file, object). Deep dive into object storage concepts (buckets, objects, metadata, access control). Overview of a major cloud provider's object storage service (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, GCP Cloud Storage).

**Hands-on:**

    Creating and managing buckets.
    Uploading, downloading, and managing objects using the CLI and SDK.
    Exploring access control mechanisms (permissions, policies).
    Basic lifecycle management policies

###   Relational Databases - Core Concepts & SQL

Topics: Relational database fundamentals (tables, schemas, keys, relationships). SQL basics: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE statements. Filtering, sorting, and grouping data. Joining tables for complex queries.

**Hands-on:**

    Setting up a local relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).
    Creating sample tables and inserting data.
    Writing various SQL queries to retrieve and manipulate data.

###   NoSQL Databases - Key-Value Stores (e.g., Redis)

Topics: Introduction to NoSQL databases and their advantages. Deep dive into key-value store concepts. Overview of Redis data structures (strings, lists, sets, hashes, sorted sets). Use cases for key-value stores (caching, session management).

Hands-on: Setting up a local Redis instance. Interacting with Redis using a client (CLI or Python library). Experimenting with different Redis data structures and commands.

###   NoSQL Databases - Document Stores (e.g., MongoDB)

Topics: Understanding document store concepts (collections, documents, JSON/BSON). Basic CRUD operations in MongoDB. Querying and filtering documents. Introduction to indexing in document stores.

Hands-on: Setting up a local MongoDB instance. Inserting, querying, updating, and deleting documents. Exploring different query operators.

###   Data Visualization - Principles and Tools

Topics: Principles of effective data visualization. Different types of charts and their use cases. Introduction to a data visualization tool (e.g., Tableau Public, Power BI Desktop, Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn).

Hands-on: Connecting to sample datasets. Creating various types of charts and graphs. Customizing visualizations for clarity and impact.

###   ETL Fundamentals - Extract, Transform, Load

Topics: Understanding the ETL process and its importance. Common data sources and extraction methods. Basic data transformation techniques (cleaning, filtering, mapping). Loading data into target systems.

Hands-on: Working with a simple ETL tool or writing Python scripts to perform basic ETL tasks (e.g., reading CSV files, cleaning data, writing to a new file).

###   ETL Tools & Orchestration (Introduction)

Topics: Overview of popular ETL tools (e.g., Apache Airflow, Luigi, Talend). Introduction to workflow orchestration concepts. Basic pipeline creation and scheduling.

Hands-on: Setting up a basic Airflow environment (if feasible). Creating a simple DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) with a few tasks. Running and monitoring the DAG.

###   Cloud Data Warehousing (e.g., Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift)

Topics: Introduction to cloud data warehousing concepts. Overview of a chosen cloud data warehouse service. Basic data loading and querying in the data warehouse. Hands-on: Setting up a free tier account (if available). Loading sample data into the data warehouse. Running basic SQL queries for analysis.

###   Data Modeling Fundamentals

Topics: Introduction to data modeling concepts (conceptual, logical, physical). Understanding different data modeling schemas (e.g., star schema, snowflake schema). Best practices for data modeling.

Hands-on: Designing a basic data model for a given business scenario. Creating an entity-relationship diagram (ERD).
