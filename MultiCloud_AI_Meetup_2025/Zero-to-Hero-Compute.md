#   Zero to Hero Compute - EC2 and On-Premises

Topics:

* Compute Fundamentals: CPUs, memory, storage, and networking
* On-Premises Virtualization: Hypervisors (VMware, Hyper-V), virtual machines, and resource management
* Cloud Computing with AWS EC2: Instances, AMIs, instance types, and pricing models
* EC2 Networking: VPCs, subnets, security groups, and elastic IPs
* Operating Systems: Windows Server and Linux (Ubuntu, Red Hat) administration
* Web Server Configuration: Installing and configuring Apache (Linux) and IIS (Windows)
